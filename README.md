# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Linux programmer interested in ARM computing and learning C. Read about me [here](https://ryanfortner.github.io/about-me/)!

Check out my programming blog: [https://ryanfortner.github.io/blog](https://ryanfortner.github.io/blog), or some of [my projects](https://ryanfortner.github.io/projects/).

#### How to reach me?

You can email me at [pinetmedia@gmail.com](pinetmedia@gmail.com) (all mail sent there will be forwarded to a different address), or simply contact me [here](https://github.com/ryanfortner/ryanfortner/issues/new).

#### Want to support my work?

You can donate Bitcoin, my address is `bc1qtssgdrjzfvgrrjedhg2jx360xn2jz5ygwgtumy`.

Any donations given are *greatly* appreciated. My goal is to raise enough money to buy a computer monitor (around $100), since I currently have to work off of a shared Mac and a smaller Raspberry Pi touch display :)
